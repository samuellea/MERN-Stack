      hey gang and welcome to your very first moon stack tutorial [Music] all
      right so to begin with i just want to talk a little bit about what the
      mern stack is the different technologies involved and how they all work
      together and also just to explain exactly what we're going to be building
      in this series so the mern stack is basically a bunch of four different
      technologies that we can use together to make an interactive and data
      driven web application or website and if you master the mern stack then
      technically speaking you're a full stack developer meaning you build the
      front end of a website and the back end of a website that's generally what
      we mean when we say full stack the front end and the back end the whole
      shazam now there's loads of different variations of a full stack and the
      mirn stack is just one of them and it consists of react which is the
      front-end library that we use node and express which we use to make the
      back end api that we interact with from the front end and then finally
      mongodb which is a nosql database to store application data in like user
      data or blogs or whatever other data that your website uses and together
      they spell out the acronym mern so how these all work together is as
      follows on the front end we have the browser where we see the website and
      our react application runs in the browser to power the website and
      typically handles routing in the browser as well to show different website
      pages then when we need to show data in the website like blogs or even
      just authenticate users we'd send a request from the front end to the back
      end now the back end is an express app running in a node.js environment
      and if you don't already know express is just a framework for node that
      lets us easily create apis so the node and express api would handle our
      request on the back end and typically interact with a database to get data
      or update data or delete data etc it would also handle authentication
      requests to do things like log a use in log them out or sign them up as
      well as protect certain api endpoints from unauthenticated users so that
      only logged in users can access certain resources anyway once it has the
      data from the database it would then send a response with that data back
      to the browser the client and the react app would handle that response by
      outputting the data in some kind of template now you might be thinking
      what's the point of this middle node api step in order to fetch the data
      why can't i just reach out directly to mongodb for the data and skip this
      middle bit entirely and the answer is that if you do that you'd be
      exposing sensitive data in your front end code in the browser such as an
      admin username and password to access your database and by putting that
      logic in the back end instead you're hiding that sensitive code from
      people who use your website so that's the moon stack from a bird's eye
      view and these are the four different technologies we'll be using to build
      a full stack application in this series react node express and mongodb so
      that project that we're going to make looks something like this it's a
      pretty simple application to track exercises that you might do but it
      pulls together all the core concepts of a full stack application and i
      think it serves as a really good introductory project i will also be
      adding authentication into the mix but i'm splitting that section off into
      a separate course that's going to be released right after this one and the
      reason i'm doing that is because a lot of other mern tutorials start out
      with authentication right off the bat and generally speaking adding
      authentication to a full stack app is arguably one of the hardest parts
      about it and personally i don't think it's the best way to introduce the
      mern stack to developers who want to learn it so we'll be starting out by
      making the project without authentication and then adding in
      authentication in the next course coming right after this one and that's
      going to look something like this where users can sign up log in and log
      out and we protect the dashboard from anyone who's not logged in and also
      every user has their own exercises listed on the dashboard as well so that
      you don't see other people's just your own so like i said that's coming
      right after this course once we've nailed the bread and butter of the mern
      stack now before you start this course i would strongly recommend that you
      have at least a very basic understanding of each of the four technologies
      we're going to be using it's not absolutely essential because i won't be
      skipping bits out and i will explain everything as we go along but i'm not
      going to pretend that knowing about them prior to this course is not going
      to be extremely beneficial so if you want to learn the basics of those
      four things in isolation first of all i've got introductory courses to
      each one of them so note and express mongodb and also react so i'm going
      to leave the links to each one of those courses down below this video also
      since we're using node.js to make our backend api in this course it goes
      without saying that you're going to need node installed on your computer
      and you can get that from nodejs.org just hit this download button right
      here and follow the installation steps and to make sure it's installed
      correctly open up any kind of terminal you can use command prompt or
      whatever else you want to use and then just type node then a space then
      hyphen v and then press enter and if you see a version number then you
      know it's installed if you get an error then it's not installed correctly
      and you'll need to try again and then finally as always i've made course
      files for every single lesson in the series and you can find those here on
      this github repo the link to this is going to be down below the video so
      if you want to see or download the code for a specific lesson you just
      need to select that lesson from the branch drop down for example to get
      the lesson two code you select the lesson to branch and then to download
      this code just head to the green code button and then choose to download a
      zip folder of this lesson there's instructions on how to use the course
      files down here as well since you'll have to run an npm install for the
      project to work once you download it so there we go my friends that's your
      course introduction out of the way and in the next lesson we're going to
      start work on the node and express back end to begin with by the way if
      you want to watch this entire course now without youtube adverts you can
      do it's all up on the net ninja website netninja.dev you can buy the
      course for two dollars to get instant access to all of it or you can sign
      up to net ninja pro and get instant access to all of my courses without
      adverts as well as premium courses not found on youtube including my udemy
      ones that's nine dollars a month and you can get your first month half
      price when you use this promo code right here so i'm going to leave this
      link down below in the video description for you to sign up and i really
      hope you enjoyed this series and please do not forget to share subscribe
      and like the videos that really helps a lot and i'm going to see you in
